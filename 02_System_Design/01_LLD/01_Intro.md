- LLD is a component level design process that follows a step by step refinement process.
- LLD (Low-Level Design)** is the "blueprint" for the actual code.
	- It focuses on the internal logic of components, defining how specific classes, methods, and data structures interact to solve a problem.

### Why it matters

- Without LLD, developers often start "cowboy coding," which leads to messy, unmaintainable software. 
- LLD ensures that the code is **modular**, **extensible**, and **easy to debug** before a single line is even written.
