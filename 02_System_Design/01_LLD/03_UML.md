**Unified Modelling Language**

It's a diagram

It is a standard which is mainly used for creating Object Oriented Programming meaningful documentation models for any software system present in the world.

It provides us a way to develop rich models that describe the working of any software or hardware systems.

UML is a **standardized modeling language** used to visualize, specify, and document the **architecture** of a system. In LLD, we use it to map out **class hierarchies**, object interactions, and system boundaries before writing a single line of code.
